## Working principle

The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) DLT is a more recent solution that offers the benefits of blockchain with better performance.
In a DAG system, there are no miners and there are no blocks, users confirm each otherâ€™s transactions via a process that confirms previous transactions with each new transaction. Because there are no blocks, there is no blocksize issue and therefore, the block scaling debate seen in currencies such as Bitcoin does not exist.

## Mining

SIMPLE due to its protocols do not need the presence of miners. Therefore, there is no need to pay a transaction fee. To make a transaction, you only need to confirm 1 going before the neutralization.
